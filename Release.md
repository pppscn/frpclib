### Deprecation Notices

* Using an underscore in a flag name is deprecated and has been replaced by a hyphen. The underscore format will remain compatible for some time, until it is completely removed in a future version. For example, `--remote_port` is replaced with `--remote-port`.

### Features

* The `Refresh` and `ClearOfflineProxies` buttons have been added to the Dashboard of frps.

### Fixes

* The host/domain matching in the routing rules has been changed to be case-insensitive.
